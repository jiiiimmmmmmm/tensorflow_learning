how to deal with the missing value?

1. drop columns with missing values. This is a simple but not very good measure
2. imputation. this is better
3. an extension to imputation. In other words, it will add several new columns to show which values are missing originally and we used imputer to fit them later.

```python
# a example

#find the columns with missing values
cols_with_missing = [col 
                   for col in X_train.columns
                   if X_train.col.isnull().any()]

# the easiest way: drop these columns
X_train_drop_cols_with_missing = X_train.drop(cols_with_missing, axis=1)

# the second way is to use imputation
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

imputer = SimpleImputer()
imputed_X_train = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.fit_transform(X_train))
imputed_X_train.columns = X_train.columns

# here are several questions I want to ask
# what does 'fit_transform' mean actually?
# ans: this function contains both fit function and transform function
# fit function calculates the values which will later be replaced the missing value 
# transform function uses these values to replace the missing value

# why variable 'imputed_X_train' need to be assigned the attribute   'columns' from originally variable 'X_train'?
# ans: imputer function 'fit_transform' return ndarray, which means the variable 'imputed_X_train' loses the columns' information.
```
